# php-mysql-search-engine


Description :

The most important part of any portal is itâ€™s effective search where one needs to fetch some data from the database.

------------

Usage :


1.) Used During My CBIX Summer Internship to display results according to the user's query. 

2.) Every client entered data via a form based on which results were shown to him.


--------------

Note :

1.) This is a dummy database.

2.) Exact project description details can be discussed but not shared on accounts of Copyright issues. 

                                      :)
